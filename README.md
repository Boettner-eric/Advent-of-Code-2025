# Advent of Code 2025

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenge.

## Usage

- `mix day.gen <number>` will create files and tests for each challenge
- `mix day.gen <number> download` will download the sample and input for a given day
- `mix day.run <number> <part>` will get the result for that part and log more verbosely
- `mix test test/day<number>.exs` will run the tests for a given day

## Goals

- no AI use
- solve most of the problems
- optimize slower solutions

## Reflection

I am pretty happy with my results this year. There are a few solutions I might circle back on but
I learned some new algorithm tricks and elixir functions and am already excited for next year.
