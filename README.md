# Advent of Code 2025

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenge.

## Usage

- `mix day.gen <number> <name>` will create files and tests for each challenge
- `mix day.run <number> <part>` will get the result for that problem and log more verbosely
- `mix test test/day<number>.exs` will run the tests for a given day

## Goals

- no AI use
- solve most of the problems
- optimize slower solutions

## Results

| Day | Module Name    | Execution time | Stars |
| --- | -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1   | SecretEntrance | 0.0134s        | ⭐⭐  |
| 2   | GiftShop       | 5.7273s        | ⭐⭐  |
